                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    Unlock the full potential of database management in Kubernetes environments using Dragonfly, Redis, and PostgreSQL as key examples. While Kubernetes was initially designed with a focus on stateless applications, this talk explores its evolved and robust capabilities for managing stateful workloads like databases.
We&#x27;ll explore how Dragonfly, with its high Redis compatibility, seamlessly integrates into the in-memory data ecosystem and how Kubernetes operators (such as the Dragonfly operator) and unified control planes (such as KubeBlocks) can simplify database operations. This session will provide insights into simplifying management, enhancing scalability and availability, and optimizing the overall platform experiences for in-memory data stores and other databases.
This talk is ideal for backend engineers, database professionals, cloud architects, and DevOps/platform engineers looking to optimize their database strategies in modern cloud, orchestrated environments.
